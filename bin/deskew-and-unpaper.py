# This script walks through all files under the current directory,
# looking for those called page-001.png, page-002.png, etc.  (If a
# version called page-001.rotated.png, etc. is also present, that us
# used as in put in preference.)  For each page the script uses
# "convert -deskew '40%'" and then "unpaper" to remove scanning
# artefacts.  (ImageMagick does better than unpaper on large skews.)
