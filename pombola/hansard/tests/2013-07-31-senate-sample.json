Yesterday we adjourned because we had no quorum to deal with the division. We are moving to a division on clauses 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13. I propose that for those 13 clauses, we shall do one division, like we have done in the past. Please, listen to me carefully so that we do not have any misunderstandings on this issue. When I put the question, we shall proceed to one division. When we come back, we shall vote this way:- I will take you through the clauses; that is, \u201cclause 3, 4, 5, 6 up to 13\u201d and then you shall say: \u201cOn Clause 3, I vote \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d as you wish. You shall vote in the manner that you want all the way up to Clause 13. Then we will take that one vote. That is clear and the easiest way to go about it. As you note, there are no amendments from Clauses 7 to 12. Therefore, on clauses 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12, you shall vote this way: \u201cI vote \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d or \u201cAbstain\u201d. That is on that cluster of clauses. Hon. Senators, with that understanding, and unless there is any issue on it, I order that the Division Bell be rung. We shall then deal with those clauses. I order that the Division Bell be rung for eight minutes.",

It is not like in other governments where the money they spend is the money which was collected and banked for the previous years. Could you come and explain to the nation what would happen if, in spite of that provision in that amendment, the Government did not collected revenue because we are talking about billions of shillings?

Now, in your new matrix, you have shared out Kshs20 billion. Could you tell us what happened to the Kshs23 billion that is now missing here and which Treasury had already told us in its Bill that it was available and ready for sharing?

            "text": "Mr. Chairman, Sir, the purpose of this clause was basically to help two institutions. The first one is Treasury because of cash flow. When we discussed it with them, they found it easier to actually handle this money on a monthly basis than on a quarterly basis. Once you do it on a quarterly basis, the amount becomes humongous and considering that the Government is not famous for putting money aside, in fact, the problem of not having enough money will begin to arise when they have to pay so much money simply on consideration of cash flow. This is something that they themselves were happy to accommodate. The other reason is that if there is a delay at the end of the month and the money is targeted to be paid on 30th, the counties will not meet their obligations at the end of the month and the lateness of their payment will be commensurate with the lateness of the national Government\u2019s payment. That is why we are proposing that this payment be made 15 days prior so that because at the end of the day, the money is already in the bank to make payments at the end of the month. This will be done in consultation with the Treasury and I am sure they know whether they have enough money or not.",

We are talking about Kshs210 billion and the total monthly remittances are about or less than Kshs18 billion per month. We are talking about public revenues of about Kshs1trillion in a year. Therefore, the amount that they collect is more than two to three times that amount. We have discussed with them and they are in agreement that that they prefer this mode of payment. It is also easier for the counties to get monthly cash flows than quarterly. The other thing that the Senator for Kakamega raised is about the Kshs43 billion. These amendment were done on the Division of Revenue Bill if you can remember and was reversed but Kshs20 billion was retained. An amount of Kshs3.6 billion was retained for Level Five Hospitals and Kshs16.5 billion for donor funded projects. The rest of the money was shared out using the sharable revenue formula that is under Schedule A. So, that is why the figures are more with regard to the sharable revenue than they are in the Bill for each county. That money was shared using that formula. This was meant for what they call \u201cholding counties harmless\u201d. However, it was felt that paying a county money specific to that county that was not there would create a situation where some counties would complain that there is no equitable distribution of funds. The money was shared using that formula. I request Members to approve these amendments. The electronic version of the Senate Hansard Report is for information purposesonly.

I rise to support and, in doing so, urge that the national Treasury looks at what we have done today very critically in the sense that it is very necessary for them, in the shortest time possible, to establish the actual cost of devolved government. Because the clause that we have added, Clause 6(d), essentially means that at some point, they may have to dig further into their pockets in order for them to live up to the law. Also, that law is actually the one that gives effect to the Constitution. Therefore, it is our hope and prayer that, in the soonest possible time, we will be given the actual cost of the devolved government because, as it is, from tomorrow, some areas are going to be operating on a deficit while others have got a much bigger surplus. Where there is a deficit, it is necessary for the Treasury to establish what the size of that deficit is in order to give effect to this Bill effectively. Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, Sir.",

We know under the County Government\u2019s Act, there is also a very clear structure of county civil service which is not yet filled.

I would like to bring to the attention of the House the provisions of the Constitution which are very clear; specifically a number of issues that you have discussed and exchanged ideas on. These are the provisions of the Constitution, more specifically the Division of Revenue, Article 217 and Section 11 of Schedule 6 of the Constitution because these are clear issues. I do not think it would be right for us to sit in this Senate and say that the actions we are taking are in futility. That would negate the purpose of the Constitution. We all know that we were not sitting in 2012 and that Section 11 of Schedule 6 of the Constitution--- Parliament did certain things which became Acts of the Senate because that is what the Constitution provides as provisional clauses. The Division of Revenue Act talks about the Senate, every five years, creating the formula. That was done by the National Assembly and that is what we adopted. However, I want to agree on this score with the Chairman of this Committee, Sen. Billow. It would not be right to tell the nation that we are doing actions in futility because of the very simple reasons amongst others that for the few days we have been debating this Bill. We have gone through all the motions and stages. We were in the Second Reading where we debated this Bill very thoroughly. Indeed, the Schedule to the Bill has been replaced by another Schedule. It has different figures. This is because the Committee considered all the issues and came up with them. We have just adopted that Schedule. We have just adopted the Bill; the Second Reading, the amendments and everything else. So, with respect to Sen. G.G. Kariuki, making a ruling on the point that has been made by Sen. Billow, I do not want to say that he is misleading the nation. It is good for us to take cognizant of the fact that we are acting pursuant to and under the Constitution.

Before I go further, I want to remind the House of the specific provisions in Article 14(a) and (b) of the Constitution and Article 246(3). I will begin with Article 246(3) of the Constitution. With your indulgence, for the record, I would like to read that Article verbatim so that it is known what I am referring to. Article 246 of the Constitution entitled the National Police Service reads as follows: (1) There is established the National Police Service Commission. (2) The Commission consists of- (a) the following persons, each appointed by the President- (i) a person who is qualified to be appointed as a High Court Judge; (ii) two retired senior police officers; (iii) three persons of integrity who have served the public with distinction; (b) The Inspector-General of the National Police Service; and, (c) both Deputy Inspectors-General of the National Police Service. (3) The Commission shall\u2014 ( a ) recruit and appoint persons to hold or act in offices in the service, confirm appointments, and determine promotions and transfers within the National Police Service; ( b ) observing due process, exercise disciplinary control over and remove persons holding or acting in offices within the Service; and ( c ) perform any other functions prescribed by national legislation. (4) The composition of the National Police Service shall reflect the regional and ethnic diversity of the people of Kenya. The functions of the Commission as laid down in the Constitution are very clear. There is no way that those functions can be varied without constitutional change. If you look at Article 14(a) and (b), you will see that; The sovereign power of the people is exercised at\u2013\u2013 ( a ) the national level; and The electronic version of the Senate Hansard Report is for information purposesonly.

So, for all intends and purposes, it must be noted that we have two types of governments in this nation; the national Government and the county governments, both of which enjoy the sovereign power of the people. Once the sovereign power of the people is invested in certain institutions as constitutionally provided, nobody can vary the exercise of sovereign power without an amendment to this Constitution, however, politically expedient it is to do so. I will go further and look at Paragraph 17 of the Sixth Schedule that I referred to in a debate earlier in this House. Paragraph 17 of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution is equally very important. I would like to refer to it because most members of the Kenyan society do not know what it contains. This paragraph deals with the provincial administration and it says; \u201cWithin five years after the effective date, the national Government shall restructure the system of administration commonly known as the Provincial Administration to accord with and respect the system of devolved government established under this Constitution.\u201d The national Government will do this. Usually, Government\u2019s actions are taken as a result of two procedures. One is a policy paper that defines the kind of action that the Government intends to take. Once a policy paper is given, then the Government can go ahead and pass laws. On the other hand, laws can be brought to Parliament without the necessary policy papers. Usually these policy papers are called sessional papers.",

One, the Govenrment must provide to Parliament its intentions, and the procedures that it is going adopt to restructure the Provincial Administration to accord with devolved government and, secondly, to establish certain laws. Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, we know that there are two Acts that were passed in the Tenth Parliament. One was the County Governments Act and the other is the Transition to County Government Act. The County Governments Act establishes exactly how county governments will work. The Transition to County Government Act gives certain transitional provisions in moving from one centralized government to two forms of government. What has happened is that the national Government has taken certain actions affecting personnel in what is commonly known as the Provincial Administration without proper policy. This is creating a lot of problems because, for example, there was a lot of hullabaloo about Provincial Commissioners, because there were no Provincial Commissioners under the present Constitution. There is nothing called a province. The electronic version of the Senate Hansard Report is for information purposesonly.

A region may be useful politically for political parties, churches or Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and so on, but in terms of Government lexicon, it is nowhere provided for either in the Constitution or any other laws under the present Constitution. So, really, you cannot structure the Government under something called a \u201cregion\u201d, unless, of course, there is, first and foremost, a sessional paper or a policy paper that Parliament has passed, which gives a region some entity in this transitional period or defines a region as something that is to be used in consonance with paragraph 17 of the Sixth Schedule. Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, having said that, we now come to the issue of the police. After that constitutional provision that I have just read, in order to implement that constitutional provision into law, two Bills were assented to by the President to become Acts in our laws. One is the National Police Service Commission Act, 2011 and the other one is the National Police Service Act. Now these two Acts are very important, because they were passed in order to put in operation the provisions of the constitutional principles that I have read in Article 246 of the Constitution. Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, I want to deal, first and foremost, with the National Police Commission Act, 2011. I am using the National Police Commission Act as, to me, a much more fundamental Act, with regard to the National Police Service Act. This is because it is the National Police Service Commission Act which actually employs. One is the parent of the other. So, it is important that when you are dealing with the National Police Service Act that, first and foremost, you take cognizance of the parent of that Act. I am happy that the Chairman of the Committee on Devolution is on the Chair. Now, if you look at the National Police Service Commission Act, it is very detailed in its provisions to comply with the functions given to the National Police Service Commission, which as I said, the Commission shall recruit and appoint persons to hold or act in offices in the service; confirm appointments and determine promotions and transfers within the National Police Service. These are constitutional provisions. Secondly, the Commission shall observe due process, exercise disciplinary control over and remove persons holding or acting in offices within the service and perform any other functions prescribed by national legislation. Those two functions of the Commission are so clear that even if you were to pass an Act of Parliament, you cannot vary them. They really must be presupposed to have existed ab initio. Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, if you look at the National Police Service Commission Act, it does not negate those fundamental functions constitutionally provided. It elaborates on them and says exactly how they shall be operationalized by the National Police Service Commission. It gives further powers to the Commission. When you look at Part II of the Act, it is says \u201cfurther powers to the Commission.\u201d This means that given what exists in the Constitution, now the Parliament of the Republic of Kenya is prepared to give further powers to this Commission. Let me just read these further powers, because it has occurred to some people that apparently, the Tenth Parliament erred in providing these further powers to the Commission. It reads:- The electronic version of the Senate Hansard Report is for information purposesonly. A certified version of this Report can be obtained from the Hansard Editor, Senate.",

Now, these are the things that had been given to the Commission, which are purely procedural, including what it is going to own property and so on. Then it goes further to the membership of the Commission. The Commission consists of nine members appointed in accordance with the Constitution. The chairperson and members of the Commission other than the ex-officio members shall serve on a fulltime basis. This is where I think the nation is getting it wrong. If you look at the Police Service Act, it gives a lot of operational responsibilities to the Inspector-General of Police. If you look at the Constitution, likewise, the Inspector-General of Police\u2019s hands are full. Then, the Inspector-General of Police and his deputies are ex-officio members of the Commission, as by the Constitution established. Some people are now arguing that the Inspector-General should leave his ex-officio membership and become a fulltime chairman of the Police Service Commision. This is contradictory and cannot really work, unless you change the Constitution. In any case, the mischief that the Tenth Parliament was trying to cure was where the head of the Police, who is now the Inspector-General and not the commander--- One of the functions that he is given, which the Police Service Commission cannot interfere with, is to command the police force. That is quite stated both in the Constitution and the Act. He is the full commander of the police force without interference. But when it comes to appointments, promotions, discipline and so on, he is told: \u201cWe can discipline even you. So, you have to be answerable to the Commission.\u201d People are now saying: \u201cNo, we want a powerful Inspector-General.\u201d This idea of \u201cpowerful\u201d so-and-so is a creature of the one-party system. We cannot really go back to it when it comes to the police force because some of us who lived under the Moi Regime and suffered for it know exactly what this absolute power can mean to you; where the man who takes you to detention is the man who decides when you are being released, whether what you did was wrong or not. They expected you to come and apologize! Mr. Temproary Speaker, I remember when the Immigration Officer, Mr. Mutua, called me to his office when they had taken my passport and held it for ten months, and he went in there, opened the Bible and read to me on how to apologize.

He has to command them, he has to tell them when to report on duty, how to dress, how to behave if they misbehaved in the field; how to handle their guns and so on, and so forth \u2013 that is the professional running of the police. Just like when it comes to the armed forces, there is an armed forces body which appoints and promotes, not chaired by the head of the army, but by the President, which is another body all together. So, Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, these things must be separated, and the debate currently going on and the amendments being proposed on both the Police Service Commission Act and the Police Service Act are actually misguided and mischievous. Really, what they should do is to look at the Constitution very carefully, not just at the part that deals, as I said, with the Police Service Commission and the Inspector-General of Police, but the fundamental article, which is Article 1(4)(a) and (b).

The previous police force, in fact, had a motto that tended to falsely mislead the public that they were a service. They called themselves \u201c Utumishikwa wote;\u201d but they were a force and not a service. In fact there used to be a joke that became a reality when we were in the university; that if you are in trouble in town and you encounter a policeman, even if you are drunk, run as fast as your legs can take you because if you encounter him, your problems will be multiplied. Mr. Temporary Speaker, Sir, we have come a long way. Section 17 of the Sixth Schedule says that the Provincial Administration should be restructured in five years. We have now done two-and-a-half years since the promulgation of the Constitution, but we cannot see anything on the horizon that shows that the Provincial Administration is going to be restructured. If anything, there is now emboldened capacity for the Provincial Administration to run parallel with devolved system, overshadow the devolved system, undermine it and make it look like devolution was a mistake. I know that the Government may be having great difficulties, and we understand, of where to take these people but The electronic version of the Senate Hansard Report is for information purposesonly.

In the new Constitution, we do not have a province or a region. We only have two levels of government. We have the county and the national government. Then we have administrative structures of the constituency which is now equal to the district and other smaller structures below them. Now, it defeats logic to ask county governments to recruit what they call a sub-county administrator who is going to earn a salary and continue maintaining a district commissioner (DC) in the same unit. The sub-count administrator is going to administer the constituency which is the sub-county, then there is a DC administering the same unit.",
