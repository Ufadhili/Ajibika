    Menu entries - for both desktop and mobile.

    We use the same menu structure twice - once in the header and once in the
    footer. However the footer does not require the drill down so there is a way
    to specifically request it. This is all here in a separate file so that we
    won't forget to keep the two in sync when doing edits.
