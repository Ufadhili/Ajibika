# VoteMatch

This is an app that lets you present quizzes to users and use their responses to
suggest the most compatible party.


## Summary

The premise is that you create a **quiz** which is then linked to a number of
**statements**. You can also create **parties** (political parties, candidates,
philosophical positions) and for each of them create a **stance** that
represents their view for a particular statement.

The user is presented a form where they are asked how they feel about each
statement. Their **submission** is saved and linked to each **answer** that they
give for each statement.

When the results are presented a very na√Øve calculation is done to tell the user
their overall agreement with each party.

The results each have a unique URL that can be shared in the normal ways.

All the various parts can be maintained using the admin.


## Acknowledgements

Originally written by [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org) for the
[Mzalendo](http://www.mzalendo.com) website to present quizzes to users for the
2013 Kenyan elections.

Thank you to the people behind
[WhoShouldYouVoteFor](http://www.whoshouldyouvotefor.com/) for their assistance
in deciding how to approach this code.


## Known issues

Currently it is not possible to reuse `parties` or `sattements` across several
quizzes. This would be an obvious addition but was omitted in the interests of
simplicity at the start and making progress.

The submission token is a random string. Collisions should be handled gracefully
if they occur.

The admin is currently very simple - should add filters etc.

It would be nice to put the statements into categories. There is styling in the
templates to display this nicely, but it is no implemented in the data model
yet.
