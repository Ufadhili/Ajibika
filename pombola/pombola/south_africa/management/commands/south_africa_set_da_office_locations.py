# This script is intended to patch the data originally loaded in using the
# south_africa_import_constituency_offices command. When this was originally run
# the DA offices (or constituency areas) had not been geolocated. This script
# reads in a CSV with the list of offices and the location information and for
# each entry tries to find a database entry to update.
#
# The CSV can be obtained by downloading it from
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Am9Hd8ELMkEsdHpOUjBvNVRzYlN4alRORklDajZwQlE
#
# The expected CSV headers (first row of CSV file) are:
#
#    Party Code
#    Name
#    Party
#    Manually Geocoded LonLat
#
# Other columns will be ignored.
#
# The organisation name will be used to create a slug, and this is used to
# search for a matching entry in the database.
