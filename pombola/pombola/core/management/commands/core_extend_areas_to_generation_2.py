# The import of data into Kenyan MapIt had the constituencies in
# generation 2, while all the other area types were in generation 1.
# This is unfortunate since it makes it appear to later import scripts
# that the district type disappeared between generation 1 and 3.
#
# This script just extends the generation_high to generation 2 for
# every area where it was set to generation 2.
