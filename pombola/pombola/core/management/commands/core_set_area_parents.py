# This script tries to find a parent for each area in Pombola's
# core_place table by comparing polygons in MapIt.  You invoke the
# script by giving as command-line arguments a series of pairs of
# slugs from the core_placekind table, the first being the kind of the
# child place, and the second being the kind of the parent place.  For
# example, for Pombola Nigeria, you could run:
#
#   ./manage.py core_set_area_parents senatorial-district:state constituency:state
#
# This is quite a fuzzy assignment, since there are errors in the
# boundaries that we have for Nigeria, and not every Federal
# Constituency overlaps with only a single state anyway.  For example,
# the Federal Constituency "Awka North & South" is (according to our
# boundary data) split between the states "Anambra" and "Delta".
#
# This script is an interim measure so that there is in most cases a
# useful value in the parent_place_id column of core_place, and
# currently the code expects that to be present to produce data for
# the "Related Places" tab on Places pages.
