# This script allows you to run the PDF to HTML conversion on a remote machine.
# The reason is that pdftohtml on Mac (via homebrew) is too recent and buggy -
# whereas the older one available on Demian is just right.

# This script creates a tmp file on the remote machine, scps across the file to
# convert and then spits back the HTML over stdout

# To use this script instead of doing the conversion on the local machine put a
# value in the KENYA_PARSER_PDF_TO_HTML_HOST setting.
