This is a sampler - a demonstration of all the possible bits of formatting that are possible.

The formatting language used is 'Markdown'. It is designed to be simple to read and write, both when formatted and unformatted. Below are examples of the most commonly used parts:

# Large heading

## Normal heading

### Small heading

There is an alternative heading style - where you underline the heading with '=' or '-' characters. This is what is used if, when editing text in the admin, you highlight the text and then use one of the formatting buttons.

You can also **bold text** and make _it italic_. You can do _**both at once**_ - but this should probably be avoided.

### Paragraphs

To create a paragraph use a blank line between blocks of text.
Without a blank line the
text
will
not
be split up

### Lists

There are two kinds of list:

- a
- bulleted
- list

...and...

1. a
1. numbered
1. list
1. (note that the numbers on the left are auto generated.

### Quotes

> Quotes can be created as they would appear in an email.

### Links

You can create links: [Link to Google](http://google.com "Google")

When linking to other pages on the site use the full path: '/person/john_smith'. Linking to other info pages (like this one) use '/info/info_page_slug':

- link to this [this sampler](/info/sampler)
- link to the [info main page](/info/)
- link to [John Smith](/person/john_smith)

### Images

You can include images if you want:

![The Google Logo](http://www.google.co.uk/images/srpr/logo3w.png "Google Logo")

These images must already be available on the web so that you have a URL to them.

### Tables

Tables can be formatted like this:

First Header  | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Content Cell  | Content Cell
Content Cell  | Content Cell
