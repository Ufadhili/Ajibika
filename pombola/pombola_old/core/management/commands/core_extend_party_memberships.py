#   "As mentioned in #494 there are lots of party membership positions
#    that have an end date of 2012 - meaning that on the site many
#    positions are hidden by default. These party memberships should
#    probably be open ended and could be changed to have end dates of
#    'future'"
#
# This script looks for every person in the database, and takes the
# most recent party membery position with the most recent end_date -
# if that position ends with ApproximateDate(2012), change it to
# ApproximateDate(future=True).
